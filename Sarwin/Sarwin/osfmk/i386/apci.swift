/*
 *  Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APCI) is for use in intel
 *  multiprocessors.  This is a list of interrupts that are sent between
 *  processors.  The Local APIC performs two functions:
 *  #1 - Within the chip there is an APIC unit receives interrupts from the
 *  processor's interrupt pins.  It then sends these interrupts to the core for
 *  handling.
 *  #2 - In a multiple processor (MP) system, the APIC sends and receives inter-
 *  processor interrupts (IPI's) to and from other logical processors on the
 *  system bus.  IPI's are used to distribute interrupt messages among the
 *  processors, or perform system functions (e.g. booting or distributing work).
 *
 *  The I/O APIC is the external part of the Intel chipset used to receive
 *  external interrupts events from the system and then relay those interrupts
 *  to the Local APIC.  In MP systems, interrupts for distributing work to
 *  select processors or groups of processors on the system bus.
//
 *  Local APIC Interrupt Services:
 *      **Locally Connected I/O Devices**
 *      **Externally Connected I/O Devices**
 *      **Inter-processor Interupts**
 *      **APIC Timer Generated Interrupts**
 *      **Performance Monitoring Counter Interrupts**
 *      **Thermal Senor Interrupts**
 *      **APIC Internal Error Interrupts**
 *  **Local Interrup Sources** include the LINT0 and LINT1 pins, APIC timer,
 *  performance-monitoring counters, termal sensor, and internal APIC error
 *  detector.  Interrupts from these sources are received by the Local APIC and
 *  sent to the procesor core via an interrupt delivery protocol set up by a
 *  group of APIC registers called the **Local Vector Table** (LVT).  Delivery
 *  protocols for source can be set to each pin in the LVT.
 *  The Local APIC handles interrupt delivery of the remaining two sources
 *  (externally connected devices and IPI's) itself.
 *
 *  A given processor can utilize the APIC's **Interrupt Command Register**
 *  (ICR) to generate an IPI.  Writing to the ICR automatically generates and
 *  sends the IPI through the system bus (on Pentium 4 and Intel Xenon
 *  processors) or the APIC bus (on Pentium  and P6 family processors).  IPI's
 *  received by a processor are automatically handled by the receiving
 *  processor's Local APIC.
//
 *  The older Pentium an P6 family processors communicate through a 3-wire APIC
 *  bus while the new Pentium 4, Xenon, and onward have utilized the System Bus.
 *  For communication between the I/O APIC and Local APIC, a bridge is used
 *  (xAPIC and x2APIC architectures).  The bridge generates interrupt messages
 *  that go to the Local APIC(s) of a SP or MP system.
//
 *  Software interacts with the Local APIC by reading and writing to registers.
 *  The registers of the Local APIC are mapped to a 4-KByte region of the
 *  processor's physical address space.  The initial starting address is
 *  FEE0_000H.  The area of memory used must be designated as *strong
 *  uncacheable* (UC).  In an MP system the (including systems with Intel 64 and
 *  IA-32 bit processors), the Local APIC registers are mapped the same area.
 *  Local APIC registers may be remapped to separate/different 4-KByte memory
 *  regions.  Processors with the x2APIC may utilize xAPIC and x2APIC modes
 *  (x2APIC mode offers extened processor addressibility).  NOTE:  Pentium
 *  processors with an on-chip APIC, external bus cycles are produced.  DO NOT
 *  USE REGULAR SYSTEM MEMORY to map the APIC registers.  Behavior is either
 *  undefined or produces the invalid opcode exception (#UD).
 *
 *  Registers are 32, 64, or 256-bit widths aligned to 128-bit boundaries.  All
 *  32-bit registers should be accessed with 128-bit aligned 32-bit loads or
 *  stores.  FP/MMX/SSE access to an APIC register or access that touches bytes
 *  4-15 of any APIC register MAY CAUSE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR OR RAISE EXCEPTIONS
 *  AND **SHOULD NOT BE DONE**.  Wider resgisters (64 and 256-bit) may be
 *  accessed via multiple 128-bit aligned 32-bit loads or stores.

 *      *1 - NOT SUPPORTED on Pentium 4 and Xenon.  The Illegal Register Access
 *           bit (7) of the ESR will not be set when writing to these registers.
 *      *2 - Introduced in Pentium 4 and Xenon.  Implementation specific: the
 *           APIC register and associated function may not be present in future
 *           chip sets.
 *      *3 - Introduced in Pentium Pro.  Implementation specific: the APIC
 *           register and associated function may not be present in future chip
 *           sets.
 *
 *  Beginning with the P6 family of processors, the presence or absence of an
 *  on-chip Local APIC can be detected using the CPUID instruction.  Execute the
 *  CPUID instruction with a source operand of 1 in the EAX register.  Bit 9 of
 *  the CPUID feature flags returned by the EDX register the presence (set or 1)
 *  or absence (clear or 0).
 *
 *  Enable or disable the Local APIC using:
 *    Method 1:  Use the APIC global enable/disable flag in the IA32_APIC_BASE
 *      MSR.
 *    Method 2:  Use the APIC software enable/disable flag in the spurious-
 *      interrupt vector register
 *  In the Pentium processor, the APICEN pin (shared with the PICD1 pin) is
 *  used during power-up or reset to disable the Local APIC.
 *
 *  **APIC Status and Location** are contained in IA32_APIC_BASE MSR
